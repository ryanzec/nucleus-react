# Nucleus React

This is a set of components used for building medium to large scale web applications built from the ground up for ReactJS.

**More details to come at an underdetermined point of time in the future.**

## Phases To Complete

* Get all core components mostly functionality with ok UX (browser support: Chrome)
* Do code refactoring to get all code within coding standards (browser support: Chrome)
* Create interactive examples for all core components (browser support: Chrome)
* Focus on getting the UX for all components 100% done (browser support: Chrome)
* Get all components working in FireFox (browser support: Chrome / FireFox)
* Get all code working in Edge, at least the latest version but also test previous version (browser support: Chrome / FireFox / Edge)
* Test code in IE 10 / 11 and determine what support this code should have (browser support: Chrome / FireFox / Edge / maybe IE 10 / 11)
* Test code in Safari and determine what support this code should have
* Build out for feature full examples that show real application type features instead of just individual component by themsevles

## List Of Things That Will Not Be Offically Supported

* IE probably will not be supported (Edge will be however)
* While responsiveness will be implemented mobile devices will not be supported
