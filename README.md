**UPDATE: I have made my decision a lot quick than I thought and I will be going through with my original rewrite plan instead of using Bootstrap as a foundational piece.  You can follow that work on the ryanzec/nucleus-react/0.8.0 branch which will be done when most if not all components are done and tested on Chrome.  The version after that will focus on other browsers testing and writing up more documentation / examples.**

**NOTE: This rewrite is an experiment. This rewrite was done because the initial interation of this framework was done and I was going to be starting from scratch anyways and I needed bootstrap 4 components for other stuff I was doing that was moving to a bootstrap based styling so figure I would take a weekend and do this and use it as a starting point for my other work. I can't say right now whether or not the bootstrap related code will remain in this framework, that will depend on a number of factors however it will probably be more clear towards the end of June at the latest.**

# Nucleus React

This is a collection of components that include:

- Custom components built with bootstrap 4 alpha 2 styling as a base
- react-tether for functionality like popovers and tooltips
- react-datepicker
- react-select

While these components are originally based off the bootstrap 4 styling, these components are not going to be designed to always be a 1 to 1 match for bootstrap components to react components. While I will continue to upgrade the bootstrap styles, I will also be making custom components when needed and other changes from bootstrap (for example, I have add the ability for a input-group-addon to be place at the top or bottom of an input and have / will not implement the nav bar).

# Notes

- This library depends on an implementation of [messageformat.js](https://github.com/SlexAxton/messageformat.js/) in order to support easy pluralization and multi-language by whatever code using this library

You need to make sure the consuming application also installs the following packages (working on updating the package.json more aproperaitely):

- react / react-dom (only tested against 0.14)
- tether (1.3.2)
- react-tether (0.5.1)
- react-datepicker (0.27.0)
- react-select (v1.0.0-beta13)
- bootstrap (4.0.0-alpha.2)
