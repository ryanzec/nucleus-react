# Nucleus React

## What is this?

Originally this was going to be a ReactJS framework of common components used to build web applications. Since then, I have decided to slightly change the direction of this project. While this will still have those components, it is not going to be focused on being a real framework that I would recommend being used in a production environment as is. This project is going to be more of a sandbox for me to experiment and play around with ReactJS (and web development in general). Maintaining a framework of this size for all the different browsers and such is just not something that I want to use all my free time doing right now.

This means that while I am still going to be testing what I build in different browsers, it is not going to be a huge priority. This should still be good to use as a reference and even pulling code out to use as a starting point however you need to make sure to do your due diligence when integrating any peice of code from this project that you do properly testing to make sure that is does what you need it to in all the browsers you need it to.
